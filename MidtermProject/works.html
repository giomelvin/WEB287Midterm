                    <p>This is a project where I had to utilize Material Design for Bootstrap to make a companion site for the Biltmore Estste. MDBootsrap has a big emphasis on responsive design and great user experience for mobile devices. It was very easy to get started and adding content was no problem.</p>

                    <p>This project was about completely redesigning the Pleasure Island, NC website. Originally I did this using CSS Grid. This version however, utilizes regular Bootstrap. I managed to replicate everything I did using CSS while making it look a little bit better and intuitive.</p>

                    <p>The whole purpose of this page is show off CSS grid in action. This page of my portfolio actually utalizes CSS Grid just like this Project. I feel like CSS grid is a lot better that Flexbox because it is easier to set up and oranize content.</p>
